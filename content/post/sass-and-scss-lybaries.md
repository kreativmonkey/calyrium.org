Name                    | Funktions
------------------------|----------
[Jeed](http://jeet.gs/) | Grid System
[Blendmode](https://github.com/heygrady/scss-blend-modes) | CSS doesn't natively support color blending the way that Photoshop does. This library attempts to fake that by allowing you to blend a foreground color with a background color in order to approximate color blending. This is not a dynamic blend; you can't use this to blend a color with an image. This was originally intended for use with the Compass Photoshop Drop Shadow Plugin but it proved impractical to integrate.
[Base.sass](https://github.com/jsw0528/base.sass) | Awesome features that you wanted
[CSShake](http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/csshake/) | Shake your Items with CSShake

[Fittext](https://github.com/bookcasey/fittext) | Compass extenstion / Sass mixin for inflating web type by generating media queries with progressively larger font sizes.
[Garnish](https://github.com/paulozoom/garnish) | Garnish is a collection of Sass mixins and functions designed to make your life a tiny bit easier.
